---

## 🏦 **Mortgages, Bankruptcy, and Miscellaneous**

### 🏚️ **Mortgages**  
Players can mortgage software properties through the Bank at any time. The process works as follows:

- **For Upgraded Properties**:  
  The player receives the amount listed on the **Software Asset Card** **plus half the cost of any upgrades**.  

When a property is mortgaged:  
1. No player can **subscribe** to the software or **violate** its corresponding license.  
2. To **lift the mortgage**, the owner must repay the Bank the mortgage amount specified on the **Software Asset Card**, **plus 10% interest**.  
3. If the mortgaged property was upgraded, the owner can only reclaim the property **without its previous upgrades**.  

**Ownership Note**:  
The player who mortgages the property retains ownership, and no other player can lift the mortgage from the Bank.
